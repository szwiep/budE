# How to contribute

You want to contribute? That's awesome. Thank you! Things can only get better from here. 

## Submitting Changes

Once you're ready to submit code, please create a pull request that clearly outlines the changes you've made. Additionally, when committing code please use 
clear commit messages describing the feature being committed. This helps keep track of changes to the project and makes reviews much easier!

## Coding Conventions

- Docstrings are written in accordance with [Google Python Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
- If you think the code isn't simple enough to understand alone, write comments!
- Use tabs for spacing (I know, I know...)
- Any logic related to the model design should stay in a seperate relavantly-named directory.
